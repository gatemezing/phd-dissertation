\section{Future Perspectives}
\label{sec:nextSteps}
Regarding the harmonization of prefixes, the work can be extended in several directions. Sticking to the two services we have studied and already contributed to harmonize, the possible next steps would be to automate as far as possible the tasks that have been made semi-automatically so far: \emph{i)} developing a unique interface for submitting namespaces and prefixes to both services; \emph{ii)} bridging the LOV back-office and the prefix-cc database using both services API in order to publish a list of common recommended prefixes. The latter goes beyond the limited framework of the two original services since such a list could be consolidated and endorsed by the main actors in vocabulary publication and management, and recommended for use in linked data applications. This could be picked up by the upcoming W3C Vocabulary Management Working Group as part of the new Data Activity\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/2013/05/odbp-charter.html}}.
