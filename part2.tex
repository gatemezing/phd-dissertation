\section*{Summary}
This part cover three main problems regarding how to present RDF to end-users. There is a consensus that RDF is not what is shown to the users.  First, we make a state of the art review of existing tools and solutions for visual representation and exploration of RDF (Visualbox, LODSpeaKr, Map4RDF, Linked Data Visualization Model, other works from the SWUI community, from Roberto Garcia, etc.) The, we present our contribution: the wizard for visualizations including the vocabulary for describing visualizations , the prototype itself, etc. Third, we present a  mechanism of extracting and reusing application contests in open data events, and finally we provide some insights on revealing the important properties of Entities for visualization.
