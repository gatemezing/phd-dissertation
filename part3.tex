\section*{Summary}
In this part, we present the various work and contributions around the Linked Open Vocabularies ( catalog description, vocabulary publications, APIs and endpoints); prefixes harmonization, vocabulary ranking metrics using information content. We also present some insights on checking licenses compatibility between vocabularies and datasets with the defeasible deontic logic for creating an automatic tool for licenses checking.  We then finish by highlighting our contribution to the GLD WG with the 2 document notes and vocabularies standardized: DCAT, Data Cube, ORG, etc.
