\\

I am grateful to the committee members of my jury, Professor M\'erouane Debbah, Professor Ana Perez, Professor David Gesbert, Professor Wolfgang Gerstacker and Professor Luc Deneire for their valuable inputs and time spent reading this thesis. 
\\

I would like to thank my friends at EURECOM and in Cote d'Azur. The list is too long to be put here. But they made my stay very enjoyable during these three years of PhD. \\

My sincere thanks to the secretaries at EURECOM for helping me to deal with all the administrative things and to the IT support at EURECOM for dealing with computer and network issues. 
\\

Finally, I would like to thank my family who stood by me unconditionally through all thick and thin.
