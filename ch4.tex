\section{Visualization Applications Over Linked Data}
\label{sec:visAppsLD}

As many initiatives on Linked Open Data is growing, tools and technologies are getting more and more mature to help pro-consumers to leverage the lifting process of the data. At the same times, standardization bodies such as W3C are helping in providing best practices to publish Open Government Data by using appropriate vocabularies, taking care of stability in the URIs policies, and making links to other datasets. It is the case for example of the Government Linked Data Working Group\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/2011/gld/}} which is developing standards to help governments publishing their data using Semantic Web technologies. Having a look at different proposals of the Life Cycle of Government LD, one of the last stage is ``Publication'' where the data is released according to the 4-5 stars principles\footnote{\url{http://5stardata.info/}}, with a given access to a SPARQL endpoint. However, for a better understanding of the data, one of the next step is usually to building visualizations through intuitive charts, graphs , etc. that will benefit to citizens, data journalists and other public authorities to improve the quality of their decisions. At the moment, one way of doing is to look around previous initiatives to see what type of application is already there, and make something similar according to a given dataset. Another approach is by organizing \textit{contests} where the challenges are to mash up unexpected datasets with clear and beautiful visualizations. Such approach is harder as developers also try figure out which tool and library is used for different applications. What if we describe applications according to the facets/views, datasets, visual tools etc.? 
%In this paper, we propose a small vocabulary aiming at describing applications developed on top of LOD for more interoperability and components reusability. 
%This paper is organized as follow: Section \ref{sec:apps} defines the types of applications on LOD, followed by a framework for assessing tools for building such applications (cf. Section \ref{sec:frame}). Section \ref{sec:reusable} deals with the facts which are common to many visual applications, and Section \ref{sec:dvia} presents the vocabulary for describing the semantics of mashups. We make some references to similar works in Section \ref{sec:rworks} and provide some outlook in Section 

\section{Catalog of Applications on the Web} \label{sec:rworks}

The Open Data Service at the University of Southampton\footnote{\url{http://data.southampton.ac.uk/apps.htm}} has a register of all the applications developped using their datasets. A catalog of the Applications using the data is available at \url{http://id.southampton.ac.uk/dataset/apps}. Each application is described by giving the name, the type of the application, date of creation, the creator and the datasets used. There is also a flag to specify if the application is ``official'' or not. This initiative seems to be isolated and by having a common layer of vocabulary for the applications, we could add more informations as it is intended in DVIA vocabulary. 

Another approach at Rensseler Institute\footnote{\url{http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu}} is to put at the bottom of the static page of the demo/application showcasing the benefits of Open Data for data.gov. is to put information, containing also a link to the SPAQRL query used for generating the application. As this information is human-readable and can help, the main drawback is the lack of a machine-readable version, using semantics. DVIA can leverage the issue aggregating many such descriptions in other Open Data initiatives as well. 

Regarding the tools for visualizing Linked Data,  the paper \cite{aba2011} analyses in detail the current approaches used to browse and visualize Linked Data, by identifying requirements for users classify into two groups: tech-savvy and lay-users. As the authors extensively surveyed more generic Linked Data browsers, with text-based presentation and visualization options, they provide some recommendations according to the size of the data such as fine-grained analysis among others. However, they do not target their study on tools that can easily help building visual SW-based applications. However, our approach is to study the tools used to build innovative applications for detecting the components that could be reusable across different domain y/o scope. 

\section{Linked Data Applications} \label{sec:apps}
According to \cite{card99}, \texttt{Visualization} is \textit{ ``the use of computer-supported, interactive visual representations to amplify cognition''}. So the unique object of visualization is developing insights from collected data. That justify why each time a new dataset is released, users always expected some showcases to play with the underlying datasets. It is true that many public open initiatives uses incentives actions like \textit{challenges}, \textit{datahackday} or \textit{contest}, etc. to find innovative applications that actually exhibit the benefits of datasets published. Visualizations play crucial role as they can easily find errors in a large collection; detect patterns in a dataset or help navigate through the dataset. 

\subsection{Typology of Applications}
Jeni Tennison\footnote{\url{http://www.theodi.org/people/jeni}} defines  in her blog\footnote{\url{http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/126}} three categories of applications using online data:
\begin{itemize}
\item (i) \textit{data-specific applications}, which are constructed around particular data sets that are known to the developer of the application; hence the visualizations obtained are of data-specific applications. Examples are the famous applications of "Where does my money go"  in Greece\footnote{\url{http://publicspending.medialab.ntua.gr/en/index.php}} or UK\footnote{\url{http://wheredoesmymoneygo.org/}}. Those applications are also called ``mashups". 
\item (ii) \textit{vocabulary-specific applications}, which are constructed around particular vocabularies, wherever the data might be found that uses them. Examples here are FaceBookâ Social Graph API , IsaViz\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/2001/11/IsaViz}}, among others
\item (iii) \textit{generic applications}, which are constructed to navigate through any RDF that they find; e.g.Tabulator\cite{tabulator06}, OpenLink Data Explorer\footnote{\url{http://ode.openlinksw.com/}}

\end{itemize}
Because most mashups are data-specific applications, it is important and necessary to  know what information the dataset contains. This could be achieve by giving the meaning of some properties or classes of the vocabularies used to create the dataset. Hence, what the data publisher needs to do very often is to make sure that the data they publish is documented. However, what is seeing in practice, is to consider using an intuitive visualization self-descriptive to both show the added-value of the data and its documentation.

\subsection{Libraries } \label{sec:frame}
We have surveyed a number of visualization tools - fifteen to be precise- used to build applications over data in general (raw or structured) based on the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Data Formats} for the format of data taken as input by the tool;
\item \textit{Data Access}, for the way to access the data from the tool, such as web service, sparql endpoint, etc.
\item \textit{Language code}, the programming language used to develop the tool;
\item \textit{Type of Views}, the different views potentially accessible when using the tool;
\item \textit{Imported Libraries}, the external libraries available within the tool,
\item \textit{License} for the Intellectual Properties rights of the tool,
\item \textit{SemWeb Compliant}, whether the tool can be easily transposed or compliant with structured data; and 
\item \textit{Creator}, organizations or persons who developed the tool.

\end{itemize}
The outcome of this state-of-the-art can then be used to assess in the choice of a given visualization tool, according to some criteria, such as (i) usability, (ii) visualization capabilities, (iii) data accessibility, (iv) deployment and (v) extensibility. For more details on this survey, the readers are encouraged to read \cite{deliverable2012b}.\footnote{Note: The survey does not contain Visual Box as it was not released at the time of writing the survey} Table \ref{tab:visuTools} gives an overview of the selected tools studied.

\subsection{On Reusable Applications} \label{sec:reusable}
%\todo{ summary of the application survey D6.1: diversity, scope, and countries} 
%\todo{show with the sample of openspending.fr} \\
%\todo{ The choice of the features used}
We first review the numerous applications that have been developed on top of datasets  opened by governments (UK, USA, France) and public local authorities. We made a random survey of thirteen (13) applications \cite{deliverable2012a} in various domains such as of security, health, finance, transportation, housing, city, foreign aid and education. The main template used was to find out:
\begin{itemize}
\item the name of the application:
\item the scope or target domain of the application;
\item a small and concise description;
\item the platform on which the application can be deployed and view;
\item the policy used for creating the URL of the application;
\item the legacy data used to build the application, and a mention of the process of the lifting process of the raw data to RDF if available;
\item the different views available of the application;
\item comments or relevant drawback to mention;
\item the license of the application
\end{itemize}
 Table \ref{tab:describeApps} provides the information extracted from \texttt{openspending in Greece} using the aforementioned template.
