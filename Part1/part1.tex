\section*{Summary}
This part will talk about the various models/vocabs for representing geography/geometry. It will survey the state of the triple stores. It will describe particular problems (coordinate systems, etc.) and highlight our contributions: new vocabularies, an online converter between CRS, etc. It will describe how geography database can then be converted into RDF (Datalift processes). It will then show how those datasets can be interlinked (possibly trying different instance matching tools) and it will conclude with a thorough analysis of those alignments together with an application that could make use of those links.
