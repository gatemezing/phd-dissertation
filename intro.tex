\section{Context}
\label{sec:context}

The Web of Linked Data is continuously evolving, started in 2007 with a dozen of datasets (cf. Figure\ref{fig:lodcloud2007}) to a large data space with thousands of datasets in different topics. From 2011 (See Figure \ref{fig:lodcloud2011})\cite{jentzsch2011} to 2014, there has been a significant growth of nearly $271\%$ of datasets depicted in the LOD cloud \cite{max2014}. The new version altogether contains 570 linked datasets which are connected by 2909 linksets, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:lodcloud2014}\footnote{A more web friendly version can be accessed at \url{http://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/lodcloud/2014/}}. In order to enable
Linked Data applications to discover datasets as well as to ease the integration of data from multiple sources, Linked Data publishers should comply with a set of best practices for publishing datasets on the web \cite{Heath2011}:

\begin{itemize}
\item \todo{add here part of BP doc of GLD group}

\item Vocabulary Usage: The best practices advise publishers to use terms from
widely-used vocabularies in order to ease the interpretation of their data. If data providers use their own vocabularies, the terms of such proprietary vocabularies.

\item Linking: By setting RDF links, data providers connect their datasets into a single global data graph which can be navigated by applications and enables the discovery of additional data by following RDF links.

\item Dereferencable URIs:  

\item Metadata Provision: 
\end{itemize}

Linked data is a new research field that uses RDF model to manipulate data on the Web, interconnect it with other data and consume it in a variety of applications showcasing it's benefits. The resulting ``Web of data'' has started being populated with geospatial data, as proved by the efforts in [cite-efforts]. Those efforts and initiatives follow the vision of the \textit{Semantic Geospatial Web} promotes by Max Egenhofer in \cite{egenhofer12} challenging GIS researchers to contribute to the Semantic Web effort by creating geospatial ontologies, query languages and processing techniques adapted to geospatial information on the Web. In \cite{koubarakis12}, the authors mentioned many research topics in the area of linked geospatial data, that some are listed herein:

\begin{enumerate}


\item \textit{Vocabularies:} How do we model geospatial information on the Web? How do we assess geospatial ontologies? How to serialize complex geometry? 
\item \textit{Query languages:} How do we write efficient queries that target geospatial Web? How do store and index geodata in RDF ?
\item \textit{Datasets:} How do we extract and convert geodata to expose on the Web? What are the best practices for representing complex geometries on the Web? How can we integrate fully compatibility of CRSs on datasets? 
\item \textit{Publication:} How can we develop scalable frameworks for covering the workflow of publishing geodata? What are the appropriate triple stores for handling geodata? What are the metrics to use for interconnecting different geodata resources on the Web?  
\item \textit{Applications and user interfaces:} How do we generate interesting visualizations of linked geospatial data? What are appropriate high-level APIs that ease the development of user interfaces for geospatial data? Can we rely on existing map platforms such as Google Maps, Bing Maps or OpenSteetMap?
\end{enumerate}

In this thesis we mainly focus on the first, third and fifth of the above topics, and acknowledge existing efforts on the rest of the topic.

\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:questions}

The Web is currently in a transition phase. After having been accessible on personal computers, it is now 
quickly moving to more and more ubiquity and entering in every part and moment of our lives. New 
devices and new ways to use them are being created. The ubiquity of the Web also creates an unseen 
abundance of information. Data is flowing onto the Web, created by users, generated by sensors, and 
stored in ever growing data farms. Geographic data is widely present on the web as they are used for location 
of Point of Interest. At the same time, many organizations are moving from legacy data stored in their databases
to structured data on the web. Structured data is already present in the many databases, metadata attached to medias, and in the millions of spreadsheets created everyday across the world.

\subsection{Modeling Geographic Information in LOD} \label{model}
The need for geolocation is crucial for many applications for both human and software agents. More and more data is opened and interlinked using Linked Data principles, and it is worth modeling geographic data efficiently by reusing as much as possible from existing ontologies or vocabularies that describe both the geospatial features and their shapes. In the first part of our work, we survey different modeling approaches used by the Geographic Information System (GIS) and the Linked Open Data (LOD) communities. Our aim is to contribute to the actual efforts in representing geographic objects with attributes such as location, points of interest (POI), and addresses on the web of data. We focus on the French territory and we provide examples of representative vocabularies that can be used for describing geographic objects. We propose some alignments between various vocabularies (DBpedia, GeoNames, Schema.org, LinkedGeoData, Foursquare, etc.) in order to enable interoperability while interconnecting French geodata with other datasets. In France, there is  currently a joint effort to publish geographic information in RDF (Resource Description Framework) and interlink them with relevant datasets. GeOnto is an ontology describing geospatial features for the French territory. We have proposed to align GeOnto with other popular vocabularies in the geospatial domain, using Silk for schema mapping and we have evaluated the results. We studied how to extend the model to take into account efficient modeling for complex geometries. By doing so, tackle the complex geometry representation issues in the Web of Data, describing the state of implementations of geo-spatial functions in triple stores and comparing them to the new GeoSPARQL standard.  We finally made some recommendations and advocate for the reuse of the NeoGeo ontology within GeOnto to better address the IGN requirements.

\subsection{Visualization Tools in Linked Government Data} \label{visu}

We first review the numerous applications that have been developed on top of datasets that have been opened by governments (UK, USA, France) and local authorities. We have then derived and proposed some use cases (8 UCs) that can be developed to consume data from the different main providers in the French level: INSEE, DILA, IGN, FING, etc. We mention that the most interesting UCs are the ones which show the added value of having interconnected datasets. These UCs,  developed and deployed, can be useful to show the benefits of Linked Data in a variety of domains such as Education, Tourism, Cultural Heritage, Civil administrations, Judicial Court, Medicine, etc. 

Regarding tools used for visualization, we have divided them in two categories, providing for each of them relevant examples: (i)-tools that operate over RDF data, (ii) and tools that operate over other structured format. We then provide some basic criteria for assessing a given visualization tool, with some weight attached to each of the criterion. 

We have contributed  on : 
\begin{itemize}
\item (i)- Designing and implementing vocabularies for describing complex geometries with different coordinate systems, with direct application to the French administrative unit
\item (ii)- Proposing a method to harmonize prefixes on the web of data  with two services: LOV\footnote{http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/} and prefix.cc\footnote{http://prefix.cc}.
